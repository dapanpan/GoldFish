Project Name: GoldFish

I. Project Overview

GoldFish is a cross-platform casual endless runner game based on blockchain technology, specifically the zkSync network. Players mint unique GoldFish NFTs as their game characters, participate in the game, and earn points. Depending on the total number of points earned by players within a specific period, the system will airdrop a certain amount of ZKFISH tokens to them. The game aims to provide a novel, fair, and incentivizing gaming experience while promoting the circulation of NFTs and tokens within the blockchain ecosystem.

II. Gameplay

Character Minting: Players spend a certain amount of ETH to mint a GoldFish NFT on the zkSync network, serving as their unique game character and associated game account ID.
Game Participation: Players use their minted GoldFish NFT to enter the game and participate in endless runner challenges. The game offers various levels and difficulties for players to choose from.
Scoring System: Players' performance in the game translates into points. Points can be earned by completing levels, achieving high scores, collecting specific items, and more.
Token Airdrop: Based on the total number of points earned by players within a certain period, the system will airdrop a certain amount of ZKFISH tokens to them. These tokens can be used for in-game purchases, redeeming rewards, or trading on the zkSync network.
III. Technical Aspects

Game Development: Utilizing the cocos2d-x engine, a cross-platform casual endless runner game is developed, supporting Android, iOS, and web platforms. The game's stability and fluidity on different platforms are ensured.
Smart Contracts: Smart contracts are deployed on the zkSync network to handle the minting of GoldFish NFTs, point calculation, token airdrops, and other game logic. The smart contracts ensure the transparency and fairness of the game process.
NFT Minting and Trading: Players can mint their own GoldFish NFTs through smart contracts and use them as game characters. Additionally, players can freely trade their GoldFish NFTs on the zkSync network.
Token Issuance and Management: ZKFISH tokens are issued on the zkSync network for in-game rewards and community governance. The issuance and management of tokens adhere to zkSync network regulations and best practices.
User Experience: The user interface and interaction design are optimized to provide a simple and intuitive gaming experience. Detailed game guides and help documents are provided to ensure players can easily get started and enjoy the game.
Security: Advanced security techniques and measures are adopted to ensure the stability of the game and the safety of players' funds. This includes smart contract audits, encrypted storage and transmission of user data, and more.
IV. Project Planning

Development Phase: Complete game development and smart contract writing and testing. Ensure the functionality of the game and the correctness of the smart contracts.
Testing Phase: Conduct internal and external testing of the game, collect user feedback, and make optimizations. Ensure the stability of the game and user experience.
Launch Phase: Officially launch the game and conduct ongoing operations and maintenance. This includes updating game content, optimizing user experience, and handling user feedback.
Expansion Phase: Gradually expand game functionality and community ecosystem based on market demand and user feedback. This may include introducing new game modes, organizing community events, and launching new NFTs and tokens.
